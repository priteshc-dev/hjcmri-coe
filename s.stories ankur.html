                “With her tiny footsteps, a little angel came bustling into our Ankur health check-up camp today,
                accompanied by her parents. Along with her came her school tiffin box, excited to get her snack, eagerly
                waiting to show her father what the teacher had packed for her today. Just looking at the
                father-daughter duo made it clear — whether a father rides a bicycle or flies high in the skies in an
                airplane, for every girl, her father is nothing less than a king, and for every father, his daughter is
                always a princess. Truly, heroes aren’t just on the screen; they exist in real life too.”

                “During our Ankur Health Check-up Camp at Subhashnagar, a woman suddenly experienced a seizure. Thanks
                to the quick presence of mind of the entire team, the woman was saved from falling to the ground. She
                was immediately placed on her left side so that the saliva from her mouth could drain out safely without
                causing her discomfort. Dr. Megha Madam also promptly examined the woman. It was observed that many in
                the crowd believed that giving a key, onion, or the smell of footwear could cure a person having a
                seizure. At that moment, the doctor guided the people present about what should and should not be done
                when someone has a seizure.”

                "Under the Ankur Project, a health camp was organized on 4th September 2023 at Ganesh Nagar, Yerwada. At
                the camp, Uddhav Vithoba Moon, a 74-year-old male patient, came with a complaint of experiencing reduced
                vision in both eyes for the past two years. During the consultation, he informed the doctor that he had
                been receiving treatment for high blood pressure since last year. After the examination, we coordinated
                with Mr. Sagar, the social worker at H.V. Desai Eye Center in Yerwada and referred him to a doctor’s
                note for further evaluation. On the same day, his eyes were examined (cataracts were detected in both
                eyes), and he was scheduled for further evaluation on 22nd September 2023. Subsequently, on 11th October
                2023, he underwent surgery for his right eye at H.V. Desai Eye Hospital, Mohammad wadi. He can now see
                clearly and is continuing his follow-up treatment. The doctors advised that surgery for his left eye
                will be performed after three months. During the follow-up after the health camp, his family provided
                excellent cooperation and expressed their gratitude to the Ankur Project.”.

                “At our Ankur Health Check-up Camp held on 2nd November 2023 at BSSK Vishrantwadi, along with the
                adults, many children also enthusiastically participated in the check-up. Some came with their
                grandparents, parents, siblings, or friends. Among them, the friendship of Mayang Dhotre, Ganesh
                Sakhare, Ashish Gaikwad, and Amit Mandal, aged 8 to 9 years, and the sibling bond between Ganesh Sakhare
                and Trisha Sakhare, captured everyone’s attention.<br>
                <br>
                In life, we may not always get everything the way we want, but one must learn to live contentedly even
                within the available circumstances. Having a sense of responsibility, siblings caring for each other
                like parents, reflects an unbreakable bond. It’s heartening to see such relationships, which seem rare
                today, still existing. Hands that bring joy are the same hands that learn to overcome limits and
                challenges. And in friendship, this is almost inevitable… like sharing half a seat and riding a bicycle
                together—possible only because of pure, innocent friendship.<br>
                <br>
                It doesn’t matter how much space you have; it’s all about true love and adjustment.At BSSK,
                Vishrantwadi, we conducted a health camp on 2nd November 2023. During the camp, a woman named Irfana
                Shabbir Shaikh, aged 50, came for a check-up. Her hand was fractured, but instead of focusing on her own
                health, she was more concerned about her son’s 10th-grade exams, which were going on at the time. Her
                hand was in a plaster cast, but she was in significant pain and needed surgery for her injury.<br>
                <br>
                When she visited the camp, our doctor and staff explained to her that while her son’s exams were
                important, it was equally important for her to take care of herself. They advised her that the operation
                was necessary. Later, on 16th November 2023, during a follow-up call to check whether she had undergone
                the surgery, her daughter informed us that she had gone to Global Healthcare, Kondhwa, and had the
                surgery. She was now recovering well.”

                “The deep love and longing between sisters is natural. Even though her sister is no longer physically
                present, she will always remain a part of her heart and memories.
                On 7th November 2023, our Ankur team conducted a school health check-up camp at Bapusaheb Pawar Girls'
                School. There, a 7-year-old student named Gargi Ganesh Sathe from 2nd grade came for a check-up. During
                the check-up, Dr. Megha Madam noticed that Gargi’s recurring illnesses were not due to any physical
                condition but stemmed from her mental state. She referred to Gargi to me.<br>
                <br>
                At first, I asked Gargi about herself and her family. When I gently asked what was troubling her, I
                learned that just a month ago, her two-year-old younger sister had suddenly fallen ill and passed away.
                According to Gargi, she often sees her little sister — while sleeping, sitting, playing outside, or
                wherever she goes. She said, "My heart aches for her every day. I miss her smile, her presence, and her
                warm hugs. I can’t forget her — I want her back." As she spoke, her eyes filled with tears.<br>
                <br>
                Being so young, Gargi couldn’t fully express her emotions in words, but it was clear how deeply she
                missed her sister. She believed that her little sister was still very close to her all the time.<br>
                <br>
                After some time, her father arrived. He explained that since the loss of her little sister a month ago,
                Gargi had not been eating or sleeping properly, and her health was affected. While gathering more
                details, I learned that when her younger sister fell ill, the parents had admitted her to Sassoon
                Hospital, where she unfortunately passed away. After her passing, the family performed her last rites
                directly from the hospital, without bringing her body home. None of the siblings, including Gargi, were
                taken to see her one last time.<br>
                <br>
                This left a deep sorrow in Gargi’s heart — the regret that she and her siblings didn’t even get to see
                their little sister for the final time. This grief was too much for her to bear.<br>
                <br>
                I then gently spoke to her about life and death, helping her understand the truth of existence in a way
                she could grasp. As our conversation grew more personal and comforting, Gargi slowly opened. After
                sharing her thoughts with me, she said she felt much better — like the questions in her heart had
                finally been answered. She promised me she would start eating properly again.<br>
                <br>
                It’s only natural — the sudden loss of someone very close is a shock no one can easily bear, especially
                for a child as young as Gargi.”

                “On 4th December 2023, our Ankur team conducted a health check-up camp at BSSK in Vishrantwadi. During
                the camp, a 12-year-old boy named Prithviraj Anil Gaikwad came for a check-up along with his parents and
                brother. During the check-up, we learned that both his kidneys had failed. He wasn’t speaking at all and
                seemed withdrawn and isolated.<br>
                <br>
                At that moment, I spoke with him and his family. While his parents were sharing his situation, they
                couldn’t hold back their tears. I consoled them, encouraging them to face this difficult time with
                strength and explaining that finding a solution was essential. I also emphasized the importance of
                preserving the boy’s mental health during this period.<br>
                <br>
                Prithviraj’s father works as a security guard on a contract basis, and his mother works in households
                cleaning utensils. In 2018, Prithviraj underwent surgery at KEM Hospital due to kidney stones. In 2021,
                while playing with firecrackers, he injured his hand and had surgery at YCM Hospital. Later, because a
                rod in his hand had dislodged, he had to undergo another surgery, and in 2023, a third surgery was done
                at Command Hospital. According to his father, Prithviraj doesn’t respond well to anaesthesia, so he was
                given higher doses of medication.<br>
                <br> In August 2023, when he started passing blood in his urine, they took him to the hospital, where it
                was
                confirmed that both his kidneys were damaged. His treatment is currently ongoing at Command Hospital.
                The doctors sent some samples to Bangalore for genetic testing. The results revealed that since his
                parents had a consanguineous (within the family) marriage, this condition was likely inherited, and it
                was inevitable that his kidneys would fail around the age of 10-12.<br>
                <br>
                Prithviraj’s treatment is continuing at Command Hospital. I also spoke with him, shared motivational
                stories, and gently explained the reality of his illness. I asked about his hobbies and interests,
                trying my best to draw him out of his isolation. Slowly, he started opening and talking to me.<br>
                <br>
                I told him: ‘For anyone with kidney disease, especially young children, I know it’s scary to live with
                kidney disease, to be on dialysis, or to need a transplant. But stay hopeful. Be careful, eat the right
                diet, take your medicines, and be consistent with your treatment, lab tests, and doctor visits.’’
