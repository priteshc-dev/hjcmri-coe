            <p class="description">
                A YUVAAN cohort father from Sone Sangvi used to frequently suffer from shortness of breath while
                talking, bathing and even while eating food. When he visited HCJMRI’s LG Center at Ranjangaon, the
                doctor diagnosed BP (Hypertension). Then he started treatment, followed all the instructions given by
                the doctor and after a few months his BP has become completely normal and shortness of breath has also
                reduced. He emphasized that the staff at LG center really do an excellent job. He thanked the doctors
                and all the staff at the LG center.

            <p class="description">
                A YUVAAN cohort family from Bhambarde village runs a hotel. All the three members – mother, father
                and the child did not get time for exercise, thus all of them were overweight. Cholesterol level of
                father was very high. Cohort doctor suggested balanced diet and walking exercise to them. Father
                started cycling and walking to go to hotel and to come back. The family reduced oil use in cooking.
                After 6 months, not only their weights reduced but father’s cholesterol also came under control.
                Their daughters play badminton daily with the badminton set gifted by HCJMRI. They claim that many
                institutes come to the village to note height and weight of the children but HCJMRI is the only
                institute which do the six monthly and annual tests of the children regularly without fail. HCJMRI
                staff also takes care of the children when they go to LG center.</p>

            <p class="description">A YUVAAN girl from Ganegaon was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes but her
                parents were clueless regarding the further action. The village representative suggested them to
                visit the pediatric endocrinologist doctor at LG center on Friday with all the medical reports.
                The doctor there explained them about type1 diabetes and how it can be managed. The doctor
                informed them about the Sweetlings program at the Jehangir Hospital in Pune and asked to meet
                Dr. Anuradha Khadilkar there. The parents did so and all their queries were solved. Their stress
                reduced significantly and now they are ready to manage the diabetes of their daughter.</p>

            <p class="description">A 58-year woman visited one of our health camps organized at Khandale
                village. The doctor at the camp found out that she has a small goiter and referred her to
                the nearby PHC to do TFT (Thyroid Function Test). Her reports confirmed that she has
                Hypothyroidism, thus doctor suggested her some medicines. After a year her goiter was
                enlarged and thus, was asked to do the TFT again to found out that she has Hyperthyroidism.
                She also lost 13.6 kg in a year. As a result of this, her confidence was lowered, she
                started facing social anxiety and could not drive her two-wheeler. Our doctor asked her to
                go to Sassoon Hospital for further treatment and she did so. After a couple of months, she
                gained 5.8 kgs, her goiter reduced in size, she was feeling more confident and was able to
                drive her two-wheeler.</p>

            <p class="description">A YUVAAN cohort father was found to be hypertensive. He was chewing
                tobacco for last 10 years. Our doctor explained him what BP is, why does it increase,
                what are its adverse effects and how to control it. He was also counselled about ill
                effects of tobacco chewing. He was asked to monitor BP for next 7 days and to quit
                chewing tobacco. After a week, his BP was normal and he assured us that he will quit
                tobacco soon.</p>
